  - Standard reasoning
  - Chain of Thought (CoT)
  - Tree of Thought (ToT) 
  - Graph of Thought (GoT)

- **Multimodal Input/Output**:
  - Text-based questioning
  - Voice input with automatic transcription
  - YouTube video context integration

- **Dynamic Knowledge Expansion**:
  - Automatic detection of knowledge gaps
  - YouTube video search for relevant content
  - Contextual knowledge extraction from videos
  - Embedding storage in vector database

- **Sophisticated Processing Pipeline**:
  - Natural Language Processing with spaCy and NLTK
  - Semantic chunking and text preprocessing
  - Named Entity Recognition and POS tagging
  - Embedding generation with sentence-transformers

## 🛠️ Architecture

The system consists of several integrated components:

### Core Components

1. **Base System**: Handles common functionality for embedding generation, video processing, and NLP tasks
2. **Enhanced RAG System**: Implements retrieval-augmented generation with standard prompting
3. **Agent System**: Extends base functionality with advanced reasoning capabilities
4. **Video Embedding Manager**: Processes YouTube videos and manages embeddings

### Technical Flow

1. User submits a query (text or voice)
2. System generates embeddings for the query
3. Relevant information is retrieved from Pinecone vector database
4. If knowledge is insufficient:
   - System searches for relevant YouTube videos
   - Video transcripts are processed and embedded
   - Knowledge base is expanded
5. Response is generated using specified prompting technique
6. Sources and context information are provided to user

## 📊 System Breakdown

### `app_gradio.py`

The main application file that:
- Sets up the Gradio web interface
- Initializes system components
- Coordinates workflow between components
- Handles voice input and transcription
- Manages user interactions and query processing
- Handles YouTube video context integration

### `video_embeddings.py` 

Dedicated module for:
- Processing YouTube videos
- Extracting and preprocessing transcripts
- Generating and managing embeddings
- Integrating new knowledge into the vector database
- Performing NLP tasks on video content

## 🔧 Configuration

The system can be customized through environment variables:

- `PINECONE_API_KEY`: API key for Pinecone vector database
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: API key for Groq LLM API
- `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`: Name of your Pinecone index
- `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`: API key for YouTube Data API

## 🧠 Advanced Prompting Techniques

The system implements four distinct prompting strategies:

1. **Standard**: Basic question-answer format for straightforward queries
2. **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: Step-by-step reasoning process for complex problems
3. **Tree of Thought (ToT)**: Explores multiple solution paths simultaneously
4. **Graph of Thought (GoT)**: Maps interconnected concepts and relationships

## 🌐 Voice Input Functionality

The system includes voice recording capabilities:
- Real-time audio recording using PyAudio
- Audio transcription via AssemblyAI's API
- Seamless integration with the query processing pipeline

## 📊 Knowledge Expansion Logic

The system intelligently expands its knowledge base when:
- Existing knowledge relevance is below threshold (0.55)
- New video content is provided by the user
- YouTube search yields relevant educational content
